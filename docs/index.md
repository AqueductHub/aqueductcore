# Welcome to Aqueduct

Aqueduct is the open platform that simplifies quantum experiment management.

We are building Aqueduct to be a user-friendly, reliable, and well-supported solution for the emerging use-cases of quantum computing. 
While qubit labs and companies focus on building better qubits, Aqueduct is here to assist in the bring-up, calibration, maintenance, and operation of quantum computers.

In this current version of Aqueduct, we provide a user-friendly GUI and backend for storing, browsing, and searching for experiment results. 
Your experiment data can be saved into Aqueduct with simple Python APIs which do not disrupt existing workflows. 
We provide easy sorting and filtering of experiments, and quick previews of text and plots so you can easily find the data that you need. 
Aqueduct is easy to try and easy to adopt.

Upcoming features including support for multiple users, automation, and plug-ins.

Quantum computers may be shared between users. 
Aqueduct will support authentication and authorisation, so users can be assigned permissions to read and write data, and to have access to system functions.

Calibration routines are often rerun regularly. 
We will provide an automation solution for the scheduling of these jobs, as well as user experiments.

A powerful plug-in SDK will allow for easy extensibility, allowing users to easily build additional functionality and integrations which can be private for their specific systems or public to be shared with the greater community. 

We welcome engagement from the community. 
We would love to hear your ideas and needs for Aqueduct and we look forward to building new features together.

Aqueduct will be a freemium product. 
The core product will always be open source and free-to-use. 
We reserve the right to charge for features not included in the core product and for non-community support.
