      solve an equation and return a text answer

    # there is a trick, which allows to
    # customise execution environments by having
    # a venv inside a plugin folder, and running
    # a venv-specific
    # python binary from venv folder. Details:
    # https://stackoverflow.com/a/54482177
    #
    # This thick allows to avoid `aqueductcore`
    # dependency on client library.
    #
    # Plugin may cache some data and librarues
    # for it's further usage, or, alternatively,
    # it may drop and recreate
    # its environment on each run.
