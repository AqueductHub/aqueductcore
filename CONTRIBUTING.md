# Welcome to the Aqueduct Project

Thank you for contributing to Aqueduct. We welcome contributions via 
[New Issues](#new-issues), 
[Pull Requests](#pull-requests), and
[Feature Requests](#feature-requests). 

Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) we use and sign a [CLA](#contributor-license-agreement-cla) before submitting contributions. 

# New Issues

If you find something wrong or broken, please file an issue with label `new-issue`. Please include a minimum explanation for how to repro your issue. At the very least include:

1. Current dev environment (OS version, Tools version, Aqueduct version). 

2. Steps to reproduce the bug. 

Your bug will be triaged (`answer-in-docs`, `already-filed`, `new bug`) and moved forward.

# Pull Requests

Please start off by opening an issue or adding to the discussion of an existing one. That way, we’re all on the same page before your PR lands. 

Several things to make it easier for us to accept your PR:

1. Tackle one bug or feature at a time. 

2. Keep to the coding style and conventions already there. 

3. Don't break anything!

The reviewers will then work with you to get your idea in to main.

# Feature Requests

We’re keen to hear your ideas for improving and extending Aqueduct. Please file an issue with label `feature-request`.  We will triage all ideas with respect to Aqueduct’s roadmap and resources.
