# First-time Contributor Process

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Aqueduct. In order to make your first submission, all contributors first need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).  Riverlane cannot accept any contributions unless they are covered by a signed CLA.   This page briefly describes what the CLA is, the steps for signing it, and hopefully answers any questions you may have about the process.

### Why do we have a CLA?

The CLA exists to formalise the relationship between you, the contributor, and Aqueduct, maintained by Riverlane Ltd (Riverlane).  Our goal is to ensure that the entire Aqueduct codebase is licensed under the MIT licence, and that the product can be used and built upon safely by anyone without fear that they are accidentally introducing unlicensed copyright code into their workflow.   

We have chosen to achieve this using an industry standard CLA template produced by a project stewarded by the Free and Open Source (FOSS) community, [Project Harmony](https://www.harmonyagreements.org).  This project was started by Canonical, the creators of Ubuntu.

Specifically, the Aqueduct CLAs are based on the Project Harmony ‘Contributor Assignment Agreement’ templates under which the contributor assigns the copyright in the contribution to Riverlane in return for an immediate and very broad license back which enables the contributor to use the contribution for any purpose.   The Project Harmony website contains contains detailed further information about the templates [here](https://www.harmonyagreements.org/guide).

### Entity and Individual CLAs

We have two CLAs (both from Project Harmony): One is for work submitted by entities (for example, if your work was done in the course of your employment at a company, this will apply). The other is for individual contributors.

The individual CLA can be found [here](LINK_TO_PDF)

The entity CLA can be found [here](LINK_TO_PDF)

The CLA applies to the contributor’s initial contribution and to any subsequent contributions they make so, once you have signed the CLA, you will not need to sign it again for future contributions to Aqueduct. 

The CLA is a legally binding document and the contributor should ensure that it has taken appropriate legal advice before signing.

### CLA Signing Process

When you first submit a pull request to the project, we will respond with an invitation to complete the CLA. 

1. The first step is to fill in an online form with some basic details (name, etc.). The form link will be in the reply on the pull request. 

2. After receiving the form submission, we will then setup a DocuSign link and share a link with you via email to sign the CLA.

Please note that in the case of an Entity CLA, the agreement will need to be signed by a duly authorised representative of the relevant entity. Once we have received the signed CLA will will counter-sign and you will receive a copy of the signed CLA from DocuSign.

### Mixed Contributions

If your contribution contains code that you do not own the copyright to, then in addition to CLA above, you will need to follow the instructions [here](mixed_cla_info.md). For example, this is likely to be the case if you are including an open source library or some open source code as part of your contribution. More details on what is permissible and the relevant process can be found at the earlier link.
