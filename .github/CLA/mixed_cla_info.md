# Mixed Contributions

This page covers mixed contributions to the Aqueduct project. This page should be read in conjunction with our contribution guide [here](cla_info.md).

A mixed contribution is any contribution in which you do not own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship.  For example, this might be the case if you are including open-source code within your submission.  The process is designed to ensure that, all contributions are fully subject to licence terms compatible with the Aqueduct's goals and MIT licence terms.

In the instance of a mixed contribution, please follow the following process:

1. Include a comment on your GitHub PR listing:
    - a) Which parts of your submission you do not hold the copyright for.
    - b) Which licenses each of those parts are licensed under, ideally with links to the original source/project where you obtained them.
2. We will then review this as part of your submission, and get back to you if there are any issues.
3. If you have not signed our CLA, you will then need to do this as with any contribution. 

Riverlane reserves the right not to accept any mixed contribution. However, we are normally happy to include content that has been licensed under a permissive license, including:

- MIT License
- BSD License
- Apache License

We will be unable to include any content which has been licensed under a copyleft license such as the GPL, as this is incompatible with the MIT license that Aqueduct is licensed under.

If your PR is merged, this mixed contributions process will also enable us to add any required attribution to the project under the license terms for the parts of your submission that are licensed separately.
